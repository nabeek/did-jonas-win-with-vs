# Did Jonas Win with VS?

We're all asking ourselves the question, "Did Jonas win the last time he played Vengeful Spirit?" Well, look no further, because here is your new source for answers: https://nabeek.github.io/did-jonas-win-with-vs/

# Motivation

Jonas. Bless his heart. He plays the same hero in every game of [DotA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dota_2) and I genuinely cannot comprehend the mental fortitude (or lack thereof) needed to do that. As I was working on updating my personal website and portfolio (which... I probably should have spent these hours towards), I had a stroke of inspiration. After learning how to execute API calls in my coding bootcamp, I remembered that most of the data associated with DotA matches is all publicly available. Add to that, the folks at [<OPENDOTA/>](https://www.opendota.com/) have built and maintain an incredible API with excellent documentation, and so here we are about 16 coding hours later.

The additional... functionality of the "triggered slider" was inspired by visiting [Money printer go BRRR](https://brrr.money/) a few weeks ago.

# Challenges

The majority of this web app was straight forward and easy to execute with the skillset built over the first seven weeks of bootcamp. More time than I care to think about (probably at least half the total development time) was spent on the slider and webpage response to it. Further, half of all of that time was spent just trying to style the stupid slider.

(As an aside: I mean, seriously, this was my first foray into the depths of cross-broswer compatibility. Why there isn't one standard for something like a slider? Webkit, Mozilla, MS... all different. I will never look at a volume input the same way again.)

# Thanks

Special thanks to Jonas for being my muse. Add CSS Tricks for helping me [wade through the depths](https://css-tricks.com/sliding-nightmare-understanding-range-input/). But also, I think CSS Tricks owes me a new keyboard from the repeated slamming-my-head-against-mine I did.
